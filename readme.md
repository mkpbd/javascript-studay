# Dom manipulation
  
## Searching: getElement*, querySelector*

DOM navigation properties are great when elements are close to each other.
What if they are not? How to get an arbitrary element of the page?

### **document.getElementById or just id**

If an element has the id attribute, then there’s a global variable by the name from that id .
We can use it to immediately access the element no matter where it is:

``` html
<div id = "elem">
    <div id="elem-content">Element</div>
</div>
<script>
    alert(elem); // DOM-element with id="elem"
    alert(window.elem); // accessing global variable like this also works
    // for elem-content things are a bit more complex
    // that has a dash inside, so it can't be a variable name
    alert(window['elem-content']); // ...but accessible using square brackets [...]
</script>
```
