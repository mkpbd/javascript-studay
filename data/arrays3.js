/**
 **************** Symbol.iterator ***********************
 *
 * We can easily grasp the concept of iterables by making one of our own.
 * For instance, we have an object, that is not an array, but looks suitable for for..of .
 * Like a range object that represents an interval of numbers:
 *
 *
 */

let range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5,
};
// We want the for..of to work:
// for(let num of range) ... num=1,2,3,4,5

/**
 * 
 * To make the range iterable (and thus let for..of work) we need to add a method to the  object named Symbol.
 * iterator (a special built-in symbol just for that).
 * 
 * When for..of starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). The method must return an iterator ‚Äì an object with the method next .
2. Onward, for..of works only with that returned object.
3. When for..of wants the next value, it calls next() on that object.
4. The result of next() must have the form {done: Boolean, value: any} , where done=true means that the iteration is finished, otherwise value must be the new value.
 * 
 * 
 */

// 1. call to for..of initially calls this
range[Symbol.iterator] = function () {
  // ...it returns the iterator object:
  // 2. Onward, for..of works only with this iterator, asking it for next values
  return {
    current: this.from,
    last: this.to,
    // 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop
    next() {
      // 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}
      if (this.current <= this.last) {
        return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
      } else {
        return { done: true };
      }
    },
  };
};
// now it works!
for (let num of range) {
  alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
}

/**
 * 
 * 
 * Please note the core feature of iterables: an important separation of concerns:
The range itself does not have the next() method. 
Instead, another object, a so-called ‚Äúiterator‚Äù is created by the call to
range[Symbol.iterator]() , and it handles the whole iteration.
So, the iterator object is separate from the object it iterates over.
Technically, we may merge them and use range itself as the iterator to make the code simpler.

/*****
 *
 *
 * Now range[Symbol.iterator]() returns the range object itself: it has the necessary next() method and remembers the current iteration progress in this.current .
 * Shorter? Yes. And sometimes that‚Äôs fine too.
 *
 * The downside is that now it‚Äôs impossible to have two for..of loops running over the object simultaneously: they‚Äôll share the iteration state, because there‚Äôs only one iterator ‚Äì the object

//====================== String is iterable =================

// Arrays and strings are most widely used built-in iterables.
// For a string, for..of loops over its characters:

for (let char of "test") {
  // triggers 4 times: once for each character
  alert(char); // t, then e, then s, then t
}

// And it works correctly with surrogate pairs!

let str = "ùí≥üòÇ";
for (let char of str) {
  alert(char); // ùí≥, and then üòÇ
}

// Calling an iterator explicitly

// Normally, internals of iterables are hidden from the external code. There‚Äôs a for..of loop, that works, that‚Äôs all it needs to know.

/**
 *
 * But to understand things a little bit deeper let‚Äôs see how to create an iterator explicitly.
 * We‚Äôll iterate over a string in exactlly the same way as for..of , but with direct calls.
 * This code creates a string iterator and gets values from it ‚Äúmanually‚Äù:
 *
 */

let str1 = "Hello";
// does the same as
// for (let char of str) alert(char);
let iterator = str1[Symbol.iterator]();
while (true) {
  let result = iterator.next();
  if (result.done) break;
  alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one
}

//============================ Iterables and array-likes ========================
/**
 * There are two official terms that look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion
 *
 * Iterables are objects that implement the Symbol.iterator method, as described above.
 * Array-likes are objects that have indexes and length , so they look like arrays.
 *
 *
 * When we use JavaScript for practical tasks in browser or other environments, we may meet objects that are iterables or array-likes, or both.
 *
 *
 * For instance, strings are both iterable ( for..of works on them) and array-like (they have numeric indexes and length ).
 *
 * But an iterable may be not array-like. And vice versa an array-like may be not iterable.
 *
 * For example, the range in the example above is iterable, but not array-like, because it does not have indexed properties and length .
 * And here‚Äôs the object that is array-like, but not iterable:
 *
 */

let arrayLike = {
  // has indexes and length => array-like
  0: "Hello",
  1: "World",
  length: 2,
};
// Error (no Symbol.iterator)
for (let item of arrayLike) {
}

//********************** Array.from ************************ */

/**
 *
 *
 * There‚Äôs a universal method Array.from Óúï that takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Array from it. Then we can call array methods on it.
 *
 */

let arrayLike2 = {
  0: "Hello",
  1: "World",
  length: 2,
};

let arr = Array.from(arrayLike); // (*)
alert(arr.pop()); // World (method works)

/**
 *
 * Array.from at the line (*) takes the object, examines it for being an iterable or array-like, then makes a new array and copies there all items.
 * The same happens for an iterable
 *
 */

// assuming that range is taken from the example above
let arr3 = Array.from(range);
alert(arr3); // 1,2,3,4,5 (array toString conversion works)

//============ The full syntax for Array.from allows to provide an optional ‚Äúmapping‚Äù function: ===========

//========== The optional second argument mapFn can be a function that will be applied to each element before adding to the array, and thisArg allows to set this for it.

// assuming that range is taken from the example above
// square each number
let arr4 = Array.from(range, (num) => num * num);
alert(arr4); // 1,4,9,16,25

//========== We can even build surrogate-aware slice on it:

function slice(str, start, end) {
  return Array.from(str).slice(start, end).join("");
}
let str6 = "ùí≥üòÇ©∑∂";
alert(slice(str, 1, 3)); // üòÇ©∑∂
// native method does not support surrogate pairs
alert(str.slice(1, 3)); // garbage (two pieces from different surrogate pairs)


/**
 * ************************ Objects that can be used in for..of are called iterable. *****************
 * *** Technically, iterables must implement the method named Symbol.iterator .
 ***** The result of obj[Symbol.iterator] is called an iterator. It handles the further iteration process.
 * 
 * An iterator must have the method named next() that returns an object {done: Boolean, value: any} , here done:true denotes the iteration end, otherwise the value is the next value.
 * 
 * The Symbol.iterator method is called automatically by for..of , but we also can do it mdirectly. Built-in iterables like strings or arrays, also implement Symbol.iterator . String iterator knows about surrogate pairs.
 * 
 * Array.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg]) makes a real Array of an iterable or array-like obj , and we can then use array methods on it.
 * The optional arguments mapFn and thisArg allow us to apply a function to each item.
