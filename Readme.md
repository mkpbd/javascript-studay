# Methods of primitives

A primitive

* Is a value of a primitive type.
* There are 7 primitive types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null` and `undefined`.

An object

* Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.
* Can be created with `{}`, for instance: `{name: "John", age: 30}`. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.
